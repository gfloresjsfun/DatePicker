# Datepicker built with React TypeScript

#### This is a simple DatePicker component built with React and TypeScript based on this requirement:

Using Typescript, design and develop a Datepicker that allows a user to type in a date in the MM/DD/YYYY
format. In addition to this, the user should be able to click a button to display a popup that would allow them to
search for and select a date. This should include the ability to indicate “blackout” dates and easily jump between
months and years.
Do not use any third-party libraries directly relating to the form and or functionality of the Datepicker itself. Also do not use any date manipulation libraries like MomentJS or anything similar. Libraries like popper are allowed.

### Scripts

`yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`yarn build`
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
